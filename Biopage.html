				<p id="para1">The first thing people notice about me is my name, particularly my first name.  My full name is Jelani Aaron Jones.  "Jelani" is swahili an eastern African language, and translates roughly to "mighty".  The name was a gift from my mother.  I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and raised by a single mother.  When I was about two years old the family moved to South Carolina where I would spend my younger years on the coast in Georgetown and, later, attend middle and high school in Columbia, the state's capital.  After Hand Middle School and Dreher High School I returned to the coast, this time to Charleston, to attend the College of Charleston.

					I was a quiet, soft-spoken kid and very shy and introverted.  I loved the summers and I loved the outdoors and was (and still try to be) and avid reader.  I had just as much fun on the floor of my room reading science fiction or fantasy as I did in the park at the local playground playing on the swings, monkey bars, and slides.  As is the case in our youth my ideas of adulthood never turn out to be very accurate.  Indeed, as I sit in my thirties I think back to the time in my life when I thought twenty-one was old.  I couldn't even conceptualize twenty-five.

				<p id="para2">My first foray into higher learning began in 2002 and the College of Charleston.  It was quite and adventure.  Suddenly, I had to make decisions that would have major impacts on the rest of my life and, looking back, some where right and some where wrong.  I say that with the benefit of hindsight.  Charleston was (and still is) a beautiful city with lots of things to do and see.  It wasn't long before I fell into that classic trap of hanging out and partying with friends a little too much as my grades would soon show.  However, I did graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology, afterwhich I went on to live and work in Charleston for a few more years.  The nightlife there was fun (too much fun, some would say) and the restaurant/food scene was phenomenal.  Downtown Charleston is know for it beautiful architecture and whole blocks of the city from the market area to Rainbow Row looked like scenes made for postcards.

				I have a varied and colorful work history.  My first job in college was as an administrative assistant in the Academic Advising Office of the College of Charleston.  The job including basic office duties as well assisting students in finding academic resources and helping them register for classes.  Just recently I've become a Sergeant in the South Carolina National Guard.  In between the two I've been a server and a catering company, a candy cook and a candy and fudge store, a medic in the U.S. Army, an EMT, and a firefighter for the National Park Service.  Ive managed to accumulate a lot of life experience.

				<p id="para3">Though I'm grateful for the awesome work experiences that I've had thus far, in recent years I've been trying to decide on the kind of work I want to do for the rest of my life; specifically the kind of work that I can see myself retiring from.  To the end, I've been expanding my horizons, first with an MBA I completed while in the Army, and now with a web developer program offered at Midlands Technical College.  Ultimately, I want to go into the field of web development and try my hand both at freelance projects and work as part of a development team either a startup or an established company.  Also on my mind is the idea of writing (blogging, perhaps?) and publishing work on line.  The future looks very bright.</p>
